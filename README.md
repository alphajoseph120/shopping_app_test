# Shopping App - Assessment Test
This project is a two-part application combining a web-based dashboard system and a RESTful mobile API integration. The dashboard, built using a provided Bootstrap template, offers essential administrative functionalities such as sign-in, category and product listings with search and pagination, as well as an order management system displaying details like order ID, status, total amount, and date. All data is mocked, simplifying development without requiring database integration. The mobile API is designed to provide seamless communication with features like user authentication via session-based mechanisms, hierarchical category fetching, product listing with filters and pagination, cart details with products and total price, and user-specific order details. Following RESTful principles, the API returns JSON-formatted data with proper HTTP status codes, ensuring efficient and secure interactions for future mobile applications.
